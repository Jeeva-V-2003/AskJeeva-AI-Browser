# AskJeeva-AI-Browser
One key innovation in my AskJeeva Browser project was the Video Search Module. It lets users upload a video, analyzes the first 20 seconds using AI, and generates a summary based on audio and visuals. It then smartly searches platforms like YouTube or Google for similar content and shows relevant results.
